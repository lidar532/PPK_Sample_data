pond area, Denver Colorado, using a 3DR Solo configured with the CWWPPKv2 systen 
and a Ricoh-GRII camera.

* 2019-0611-Co-M600: UAS (DJI M-600). A USGS DJI M600 flight in Colorado.  A nearby 
CORS (CTMC) base station is used as a base station.

* 2018-0326-USVI: UAS (Solo). A flight over the south coast of Buck Island, St. Croix, USVI. 
This dataset contains two flights.  It uses a second CWW-PPK base station located

of the second flight.  The second flight can be processed using a PPP trajectory
produced by the free online PPP processor in Canada.
